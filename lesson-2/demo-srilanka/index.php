        Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements that dates
        back at least 125,000 years.[14] The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the
        PƒÅli canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE.[15][16] Also called the Teardrop of
        India, or the Granary of the East, Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours have made it of great
        strategic importance, from the earliest days of the ancient Silk Road trade
